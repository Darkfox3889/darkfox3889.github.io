                    <p>Every day, we are exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UV) that is aging and killing&nbsp;us. Unprotected exposure to UV from the sun in our daily lives is the primary cause of both skin aging and skin cancer.</p>

                    <p>Thankfully, scientists have created the UV index. Using a simple number scale of 1 to 11+, the UV index shows the risk of skin damage from the sun at a given time and place. <em>Sun Risk</em> uses the UV index.</p>
