                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today an important update for Sun Risk has been released on the App Store. This update is important not only for the great performance and reliability improvements it brings, but also because it marks the first fruits of a new development philosophy I am taking with Sun Risk.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I design and develop Sun Risk completely on my own. Over the past few years, Sun Risk grew from being simply an iOS widget into a full-featured app, and even expanded to include Apple Watch components. While these features were great when they were released, it has been difficult to maintain all the different components of Sun Risk with the time and attention they deserve. Sun Risk is a labor of love that I built to bring beautiful and simple interface design to the field of UV index apps. Work on Sun Risk happens entirely in my free time, when I'm not busy with my full-time job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As such, I feel now is the time to go back to basics with Sun Risk. This new release of Sun Risk focuses on quality and reliability, and given my limited time, some existing features have to go away temporarily. The new version of Sun Risk will show the UV forecast for a single location (your current location) in both the app and the widget. The Apple Watch app and complications are not included in this new release. That being said, I am going to continue working on getting the Watch components back in top-notch shape and out to all of you as soon as possible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you so much for choosing to use Sun Risk in your own life, and I really hope you enjoy the fresh new design this update brings!
                        <br>
