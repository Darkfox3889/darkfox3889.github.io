                The UV Index is a measurement of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
                <br>
                <br>
                The UV Index shows how intense the sun's rays are at a given time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Too much exposure to UV rays can cause skin damage.
                <br>
                <br>
                This can result in sun burns, as well as premature aging and wrinkling of the skin.
                <br>
                <br>
                UV over-exposure is also the primary cause of the skin cancer Melanoma.

                Instant access to the UV index takes the guess work out of knowing when you need sun protection.

                BUG NOTICE: UVs Higher than 11!
                <br>
                </b><i>6/19/2015</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                When I originally coded SunDial, I did not realize the UV Index could actually go higher than 11!
                <br>
                As such, SunDial does not display the correct colors for UV over 11 in the full app. 
                <br>
                Additionally, the Apple Watch app unfortunately crashes if the UV gets above 11.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, I have now fixed this and SunDial will now properly function no matter how high the UV gets!
                <br>
                The update has been submitted to Apple but it may be a few weeks before it is available in the store.
                <br>
                <br>
                I apologize for this inconvenience!
