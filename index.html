                <br>
                <br>
                There is currently a bug in SunDial which prevents it from working if your device is in 24 hour time mode.
                <br>
                <br>
                A fix has already been submitted to the App Store and is awaiting approval.
                <br>
                <br>
                Apologies to anyone affected by this!
