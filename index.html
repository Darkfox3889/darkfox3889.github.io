                    </h1>
                    <p class = "blue">Every day, we are exposed to ultraviolet radiation that is aging and killing us. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is part of the sun’s rays. Unprotected exposure to UV from the sun in our daily lives is the primary cause of both skin aging and skin cancer.</p>
                    <h2 class = "yellow">ALMOST ALL SKIN AGING IS DUE TO SUN EXPOSURE</h2>
                    <p>Up to 90 percent of the visible skin changes commonly attributed to aging including wrinkles and sagging are caused by exposure to UV from the sun. With proper protection from UV exposure, most premature aging of the skin can be avoided.</p>
                    <h2 class = "yellow">NEARLY ALL SKIN CANCER IS DUE TO SUN EXPOSURE</h2>
                    <p>Greater than 90 percent of skin cancers are caused by exposure to UV in the sun’s rays. Skin cancer is now the most common form of cancer, accounting for at least 40% of all cancer diagnoses globally.</p>
                    <h2 class = "yellow">ONE AMERICAN DIES FROM SKIN CANCER EVERY HOUR</h2>
                    <p>More than 3.5 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States every year, making it the most common cancer in the United States. If we keep ignoring sun-protection as we have been, it is estimated that one in five Americans will be diagnosed with skin cancer in their lifetime.</p>
